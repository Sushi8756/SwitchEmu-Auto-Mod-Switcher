# SwitchEmu-Auto-Mod-Switcher
Just a quick and easy mod swapper made with batch files if you want to put certain switch mods on something like Steam Rom Manager without needing to manually swap it yourself.
Mainly so you can open the batch file from something like Steam Rom Manager, so you can open lets say Mario Kart 8 Deluxe AND CTGP8DX from Steam without needing to manually change your mod folder.

Download the code as a .zip for now.

Setup:
1) Edit the filepath.txt (instructions on that file)
2) Change folder names (if you want)
(Note: if you want to rename a folder, rename the batch file for that folder AND all instances of the folder name inside that batch file should also be changed [Lines 23 & 25])
3) Add mod folders (also if you want)
(Note: just like the note from 2, but copy and paste a batch file and folder and rename for a new mod)

Pretty simple, but it works :)
